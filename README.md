# NOTE :-

## This extension is the same as the extension [Gist Manager](https://github.com/FezVrasta/gist-manager) By FezVrasta except that the theme has been changed to allow you to use it properly with dark themes so that it is readable.
## The gist-manager.css file in style folder has been edited so if you wish to change theme you can edit that file.


## Usage:
To show Gist Manager click on **`View > Show Gist Manager`**, the panel will appear on bottom of Brackets.
